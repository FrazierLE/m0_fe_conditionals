1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
String interpolaltion. I need to do more research so I understand it better and just continue to practice.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I am just trying to wrap my head around string interpolaltion. Chatting with my friend who went through Turing was really helpful today.
